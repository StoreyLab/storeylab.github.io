      <description> The Storey Lab&amp;rsquo;s current research efforts are in the following areas:
Extending fundamental population genetics models and quantities &amp;mdash; such as allele frequencies, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, FST, admixture, ancestry, and kinship &amp;mdash; to genome-wide genotype data making minimal assumptions about population structure Improving the accuracy and applicability of the polygenic trait model in population-based studies for determining the genetic basis of complex traits, including association studies, genome-wide heritability, and polygenic risk scores Developing causal inference methods and study designs for population-based genetics studies of complex traits Latent variable decompositions of high-dimensional data, with an emphasis on admixture, population structure, and exponential family distributions Latent variable modeling in the context of high-dimensional significance testing &amp;mdash; such as surrogate variable analysis and cross-dimensional inference Signficance testing on high-dimensional regression models Models and estimators for false discovery rates and q-values </description>

      <description>biobroom. This R package converts standard objects constructed by bioinformatics packages, especially those in Bioconductor, to the tidy data format. Bioconductor / GitHub
bnpsd. This R package simulates admixed populations via simulated allele frequencies and genotypes from the BN-PSD (&amp;ldquo;Balding-Nichols Pritchard-Stephens-Donnelly&amp;rdquo;) admixture model. This model enables the simulation of complex population structures, ideal for illustrating challenges in kinship coefficient and FST estimation. CRAN / GitHub
dnamix. This Fortran program calcluates likelihood ratios as they pertain to mixed DNA samples encountered in forensic science.</description>
